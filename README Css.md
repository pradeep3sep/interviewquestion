> ### CSS Combinator Selectors

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space)
- direct child selector (>) (not the nested)
- adjacent sibling selector (+)
- general sibling selector (~)

> ### Pseudo-elements : befor and after
A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

> ### Pseudo-classes/ Pseudo selector : hover,focus,active,link,first child,last child,nth child
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

> ### CSS Attribute Selectors

CSS [attribute] Selector\
The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

The following example selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:

```css
a[target] {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

```css
a[target="_blank"] {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

> ### Box-Sizing :
- The box-sizing property in CSS is used to control how the total width and height of an HTML element is calculated. It has two possible values: `content-box and border-box`.
- The default value for box-sizing is content-box. This means that the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content of the element, excluding padding and border.
- If you set the value of box-sizing to border-box, the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content, padding, and border of the element. This can be useful in situations where you want to set a specific width for an element that includes its padding and border, rather than having to calculate the total width manually.
