Below is the storage by reference
```js
let person = { name: "Jayesh" };
  const personArray = [person];
  person = null;
  console.log(personArray);

  personArray = [];
  console.log(personArray);

  // üëçA) [ { name: "Jayesh" } ], []
  // üí°B) [ { name: "Jayesh" } ] , TyperError
  // üíñC) [ null ], TypeError
  // üòÄD) [ {} ], []

  /*
  Answer is B) [ { name: "Jayesh" } ] , TyperError because person = null will only disconnect the person variable from value { name: "Jayesh"} which is stored in memory, personArray[0] will still point to same value { name: "Jayesh"}.
  and personArray = [] at this line TyperError as const variable can't be redeclared and throws Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.  
 */
