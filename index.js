//* html 5 comes with semantic tags
//* doctype in html, 
//All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect. In HTML 5, the declaration is simple: <!DOCTYPE html>

//* Iframe in html : An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
//* HTML Formatting Elements 
// Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
// <b> - Bold text
// <strong> - Important text
// <i> - Italic text
// <em> - Emphasized text
// <mark> - Marked text
// <small> - Smaller text
// <del> - Deleted text
// <ins> - Inserted text
// <sub> - Subscript text
// <sup> - Superscript text

//* Difference between <b> and <strong> Elements
// The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance. The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

//*   semantic tag === A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

//! -------------------------CSS ------------------------

//* Box-Sizing :
// The box-sizing property in CSS is used to control how the total width and height of an HTML element is calculated. It has two possible values: content-box and border-box.
// The default value for box-sizing is content-box. This means that the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content of the element, excluding padding and border.
// If you set the value of box-sizing to border-box, the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content, padding, and border of the element. This can be useful in situations where you want to set a specific width for an element that includes its padding and border, rather than having to calculate the total width manually.

//* Pseudo-elements : befor and after
//A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

//* Pseudo-classes/ Pseudo selector : hover,focus,active,link,first child,last child,nth child
// A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

//* What is flexbox
// Flexbox is a layout module in CSS that provides a more efficient and flexible way to arrange and align elements in a container. The main idea behind Flexbox is that you can turn any container element into a flexible container,

//* Position in css
// position: static;
// position: relative;
// position: absolute;
// position: fixed;
// position: sticky;

//* Screen meaning in media queries

//* Advantage of CSS3 over CSS  === refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantage-of-css3-over-css/    and some are Responsiveness or Media queries,new color formats Colors, advanced Animations, etc

//*   diff between visibility and d none  == visibility:hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout. display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space.

//* What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?
// Class Inheritance: instances inherit from classes (like a blueprint - a description of the class), and create sub-class relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies. Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the new keyword. Class
// inheritance may or may not use the class keyword from ES6.
// Prototypal Inheritance: instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions
// or Object.create(). Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance.
